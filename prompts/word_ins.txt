id:{random_id}:Please generate 80 pairs of sentences that illustrate natural speech dysfluency through word insertion patterns. The sentences should specifically model realistic dysfluent speech patterns with insertions marked with [INS]. This data will support research on speech dysfluency detection and analysis. Follow these instructions:

1. **Output Structure**:
   - Provide components for each pair:
     - **Fluent Sentence**: A grammatically complete, fluent sentence as would appear in written text
     - **Dysfluent Sentence**: The same sentence with one word insertion representing a natural speech dysfluency
     - **Label**: A sentence marking the inserted dysfluency with [INS]
     - **Category**: 
         - Inserted_Filler 
         - Inserted_Repetition 
         - Inserted_Restart 
         - Inserted_Discourse_Marker
         - Inserted_Hedge 
         - Inserted_Correction_Marker 
         - Inserted_Pause_Filler 
         - Inserted_False_Start
         - Inserted_Interjection 
         - Inserted_Hesitation_Marker
         - More...

2. **Required Speech Dysfluency Patterns**:
   - Fillers during cognitive planning 
   - Hesitations before complex grammatical structures
   - False starts and self-corrections
   - Discourse markers at topic transitions
   - Filled pauses during information retrieval
   - Hedges before uncertain information
   - Interjections representing thought interruptions
   - Dysfluencies at syntactic boundaries
   - Hesitations before low-frequency words

3. **Sentence Length Distribution**:
   - Short (3-6 words): 30 sentences
   - Medium (7-15 words): 30 sentences
   - Long (16-35 words): 20 sentences

4. **Speech Context Categories** (8 examples each):
   - Spontaneous explanations
   - Unprepared responses to questions
   - Emotional or high-stress speaking situations
   - Technical explanations by non-experts
   - Descriptions of complex processes
   - Recalling past events
   - Narrative storytelling
   - Public speaking scenarios
   - Conversations requiring cognitive effort
   - Second language speaking contexts

5. **Example Format**:

   {RANDOM_EXAMPLE_WORD}

6. **Final Output Format**:
   {
     'sentence_pairs': [
       {
         'id': 1,
         'correct': '',
         'dysfluent': '',
         'label': '',
         'category': ''
       }
     ]
   }

7. **Validation Requirements**:
    Each example must:
    - Include exactly one realistic speech dysfluency insertion
    - Represent authentic patterns found in spontaneous speech
    - Occur at plausible locations for dysfluencies
    - Maintain the underlying communicative intent
    - Use appropriate dysfluency category label
    - Be consistent with psycholinguistic research on speech production

Generate exactly 80 pairs in the specified JSON format, ensuring:
- Varied positions of dysfluencies
- Diverse syntactic structures
- Varied sentence lengths
- Multiple speech contexts
- Natural dysfluency points that reflect cognitive processing
- Realistic speech production patterns

Each example should represent an authentic speech dysfluency that could occur in natural conversation, reflecting the challenges of real-time language production.
