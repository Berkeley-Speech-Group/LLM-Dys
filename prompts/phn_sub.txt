Please generate pairs of sequences that illustrate natural **single phoneme substitution** patterns. The sequences should be diverse in context and structure to support scaling analysis.

### **Input Format:**

The following fields should be provided in your API request:

- **id**: An identifier for the sample (either integer or string)
- **reference_text**: The original English text to be used
- **cmu_correct**: The CMU phoneme sequence **without stress markers**
- **ipa_correct**: The corresponding IPA phoneme sequence

### Example Input:


{
    "id": 1,
    "reference_text": "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "cmu_correct": "DH AH K AE T S AE T AA N DH AH M AE T",
    "ipa_correct": "ðə kˈæt sˈæt ˈɑn ðə mˈæt"
}


### **Output Format:**

Generate JSON objects with the following fields:
- **id**: The same identifier provided in the input.
- **dysfluent_word**: The word in which the phoneme substitution occurs.
- **ipa_correct**: The **correct** IPA sequence of the word before substitution.
- **cmu_correct**: The **correct** CMU sequence of the word before substitution.
- **ipa_dysfluent**: The IPA phoneme sequence of the word with the substituted phoneme + `[SUB]` tag.
- **cmu_dysfluent**: The CMU phoneme sequence of the word with the substituted phoneme + `[SUB]` tag.
- **category**: The phonetic classification of the substituted phoneme (e.g., "Plosive", "Fricative", etc.).

### **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Must SUBSTITUTE an actual phoneme with a different phoneme followed by a `[SUB]` tag.
2. The `[SUB]` tag must appear IMMEDIATELY AFTER the substituted phoneme.
3. Substitutions must occur WITHIN words, not at word boundaries.
4. The substituted phoneme must be different from the original phoneme.

### Format Rules:
1. In CMU format:
   ``` 
   CORRECT:   "M IH N[SUB] K"  (N substituted for L in "milk")
   WRONG:     "M IH L K [SUB]"   (no phoneme substituted, just a tag added)
   ```

2. In IPA format:
   ``` 
   CORRECT:   "mˈɪn[SUB]k"     (n substituted for l in "milk")
   WRONG:     "mˈɪlk[SUB]"      (no phoneme substituted, just a tag added)
   WRONG:     "mˈɪlk"      (no substitution indicated)
   ```

### Valid Output Example:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "dysfluent_word": "milk",
        "ipa_correct": "mˈɪlk",
        "cmu_correct": "M IH L K",
        "ipa_dysfluent": "mˈɪn[SUB]k",
        "cmu_dysfluent": "M IH N[SUB] K",
        "category": "Nasal"
    }
]
```

### Invalid Examples:

```json
// INVALID - No actual phoneme substituted
{
    "cmu_dysfluent": "M IH L K [SUB]"  // Wrong: just added [SUB] tag without substituting a phoneme
}

// INVALID - Same phoneme
{
    "cmu_dysfluent": "M IH L[SUB] K"  // Wrong: no actual substitution occurred
}
```

### **Key Instructions:**

1. **Substitution Format**:
   - Replace original phoneme with a different phoneme.
   - Add [SUB] tag immediately after the substituted phoneme.
   - Must be within a word.

2. **Phoneme Selection**:
   - Choose a substitute phoneme that is phonologically plausible.
   - Must be different from the original.
   - Should follow common substitution patterns (e.g., voicing changes, place of articulation shifts).

3. **Position Rules**:
   - Only substitute within words.
   - Never at word boundaries.
   - Always substitute an existing phoneme.

4. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check that a phoneme is actually substituted.
   - Verify [SUB] tag follows immediately after the substituted phoneme.
   - Confirm substitution is within a word.
   - Ensure no spaces around substitution tag.
   - Ensure the substituted phoneme differs from the original.
   - Valid examples should contain one substitution that follows common phonological patterns.

### **Note**:
Generate the output as pure JSON data without additional instructions or explanations. Each sequence should include exactly one within-word substitution that creates a natural-sounding result while reflecting common phonological processes.

Generate 10 pairs corresponding to the following input. All pairs at once, don't truncate the response.
