### **Input Format:**

The following fields should be provided in your API request:

- **id**: An identifier for the sample (either integer or string).
- **reference_text**: The original English text to be used.
- **cmu_correct**: The CMU phoneme sequence **without stress markers**.
- **ipa_correct**: The corresponding IPA phoneme sequence.

### Example Input:

{
"id": 5034,
"reference_text": "The economist predicted a recession in the coming quarter.",
"cmu_correct": "DH AH IH K AA N AH M IH S T P R IH D IH K T IH D AH R IH S EH SH AH N IH N DH AH K AH M IH NG K W AO R T ER",
"ipa_correct": "ðɪ ɪkˈɑːnəmˌɪst pɹɪdˈɪktᵻd ɐ ɹᵻsˈɛʃən ɪnðə kˈʌmɪŋ kwˈɔːɹɾɚ."
},

### Output Format:

## only the json data , no instructions like:'Here are the generated pairs of phoneme sequences illustrating natural stuttering patterns with phoneme prolongations:'

Generate JSON objects with the following fields:

- id: The same identifier provided in the input.
- ipa_label: The IPA phoneme sequence where [PRO] is placed immediately after the prolonged element.
  Example: If "i" is prolonged in "ɪvˈæljuː":
  Original: "ɪvˈæljuː"
  With label: "ɪvˈæ [PRO] lju"

- cmu_label: The CMU phoneme sequence where [PRO] is placed immediately after the prolonged phoneme.

Example: If "IY" is prolonged in "IH V AE L Y IY":

Original: "IH V AE L Y IY"
With label: "IH V AE L Y IY [PRO]"

### Example Output:

[

{
"id": 5034,
"ipa_label": "ðɪ ɪkˈɑːnəmˌɪst pɹɪdˈɪ [PRO] ktᵻd ɐ ɹᵻsˈɛʃən ɪnðə kˈʌmɪŋ kwˈɔːɹɾɚ."
"cmu_label": "DH AH IH K AA N AH M IH S T P R IH D IH [PRO] K T IH D AH R IH S EH SH AH N IH N DH AH K AH M IH NG K W AO R T ER"
},

### **Key Instructions for Prolongation Pattern:**

1. **Prolongation Location**:

   - Prolongation should occur only on **vowels** in the sequence.
   - The prolonged element must be marked with `[PRO]`.

2. **Phonetic Context**:

   - Prolonged vowels should appear **naturally**, reflecting common speech patterns.
   - Include a variety of **long and short vowels**, and ensure diversity across different vowel categories.

3. **Natural Prolongation Patterns**:

   - Ensure the prolongation reflects **natural prosody**, such as stress, rhythm, and speech flow.
   - Prioritize prolongations in **content words** (e.g., nouns, verbs) over function words.

4. **Phonetic Environment**:
   - Prolonged vowels must correspond to **real-world articulation behaviors**.
   - Ensure the transcription accurately reflects the vowel's duration in both **CMU** and **IPA** sequences.

### **Output Distribution:**

- Prolongations should reflect **real-world behaviors** of vowel elongation.
- The focus should be on **common vowel prolongation patterns** in natural speech.

### **Note**:

Each pair should include **one vowel prolongation**. Create the prolongation to make it as natural as possible.  
Double check if you calculate the phoneme_index correctly.

Generate 10 pairs corresponding to the following input. All pairs in once ,don't tell like this'[Response truncated due to length. I can continue with the remaining pairs if needed. Each pair follows the same pattern of including natural stuttering prolongations focused on initial syllables and high-risk consonants while maintaining phonetic accuracy and proper labeling.]
Would you like me to continue with the remaining pairs?', the max_token is enough for your work
