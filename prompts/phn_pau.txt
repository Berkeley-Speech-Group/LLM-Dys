### **Input Format **:

The fields to be included in your API request:

- **id**: An identifier for the sample (either integer or string).
- **reference_text**: The original English text to be used.
- **cmu_correct**: The CMU phoneme sequence **without stress markers**.
- **ipa_correct**: The corresponding IPA phoneme sequence.

### Example Input :


{
  "id": 5034,
  "reference_text": "The economist predicted a recession in the coming quarter.",
  "cmu_correct": "DH AH IH K AA N AH M IH S T P R IH D IH K T IH D AH R IH S EH SH AH N IH N DH AH K AH M IH NG K W AO R T ER",
  "ipa_correct": "ðɪ ɪkˈɑːnəmˌɪst pɹɪdˈɪktᵻd ɐ ɹᵻsˈɛʃən ɪnðə kˈʌmɪŋ kwˈɔːɹɾɚ."
}


### **Output Format **:

For each pair, generate the following fields:

- **id**: The same identifier provided in the input.
- **ipa_label**: The IPA phoneme sequence where the [PAU] marker is placed within words (not between words).
  - Example: If there’s a natural pause/block inside the word, insert [PAU] at the pause point.
  - For example, if a pause occurs inside the word "predicted" at the “t”, the output should be:
    - Original: "pɹɪdˈɪktᵻd"
    - With marker: "pɹɪdˈɪk[PAU]tᵻd"
  
- **cmu_label**: The CMU phoneme sequence where the [PAU] marker is placed inside words (not between words).

### Example Output :


[
  {
    "id": 5034,
    "ipa_label": "ðɪ ɪkˈɑːnəmˌɪst pɹɪdˈɪk[PAU]tᵻd ɐ ɹᵻsˈɛʃən ɪnðə kˈʌmɪŋ kwˈɔːɹɾɚ.",
    "cmu_label": "DH AH IH K AA N AH M IH S T P R IH D IH [PAU] K T IH D AH R IH S EH SH AH N IH N DH AH K AH M IH NG K W AO R T ER"
  },
  {
   ...
  }
]


### **Key Instructions for Pause/Block Marker**:

1. **Pause/Block Location**:
   - The pause/block should only occur **within words**, not between words.
   - The pause/block marker **[PAU]** must be placed at the phoneme level where a natural pause occurs within a word, but not at the word boundary.

2. **Phonetic Context for Pause/Block**:
   - **Natural pauses/blocks**: The pause/block should reflect realistic speech behaviors, such as hesitation or interruptions.
   - **The pause/block should occur in appropriate linguistic contexts** such as after consonants or in places where speech tends to pause naturally.

3. **Phonetic Environment**:
   - The pause/block should appear inside the word, not at word boundaries.
   - It should occur at a **natural stopping point** inside the word, such as after a consonant or within syllables.

4. **Accuracy**:
   - Ensure that the insertion of [PAU] does not affect the overall phonetic accuracy of the transcription.

This structure now correctly handles the insertion of pause markers within words, and ensures that pauses do not appear at word boundaries. Would you like to test this with a set of examples or make any further adjustments?


### **Note**:  

Each pair should include **one pause** within one word. Create the pause to make it as natural as possible.  

Generate 10 pairs corresponding to the following input. All pairs in once ,don't tell like this'[Response truncated due to length. I can continue with the remaining pairs if needed. Each pair follows the same pattern of including natural stuttering pause focused on initial syllables and high-risk consonants while maintaining phonetic accuracy and proper labeling.]
