Please generate pairs of sequences that illustrate natural **single phoneme deletion** patterns. The sequences should be diverse in context and structure to support scaling analysis.

### **Input Format:**

The following fields should be provided in your API request:

- **id**: An identifier for the sample (either integer or string)
- **reference_text**: The original English text to be used
- **cmu_correct**: The CMU phoneme sequence **without stress markers**
- **ipa_correct**: The corresponding IPA phoneme sequence

### Example Input:


{
    "id": 1,
    "reference_text": "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "cmu_correct": "DH AH K AE T S AE T AA N DH AH M AE T",
    "ipa_correct": "ðə kˈæt sˈæt ˈɑn ðə mˈæt"
}


### **Output Format:**

Generate JSON objects with the following fields:
- **id**: The same identifier provided in the input.
- **dysfluent_word**: The word in which the phoneme deletion occurs.
- **ipa_correct**: The **correct** IPA sequence of the word before deletion.
- **cmu_correct**: The **correct** CMU sequence of the word before deletion.
- **ipa_dysfluent**: The IPA phoneme sequence of the word with the deletion marked by `[DEL]` tag.
- **cmu_dysfluent**: The CMU phoneme sequence of the word with the deletion marked by `[DEL]` tag.
- **category**: The phonetic classification of the deleted element (e.g., "Plosive", "Fricative", etc.).

### **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
1. Must DELETE an actual phoneme and replace it with a `[DEL]` tag.
2. The `[DEL]` tag must appear EXACTLY where the phoneme was deleted.
3. Deletions must occur WITHIN words, not at word boundaries.
4. The deleted phoneme must be a single phoneme.

### Format Rules:
1. In CMU format:
   ``` 
   CORRECT:   "M IH [DEL] K"  (L deleted from "milk")
   WRONG:     "M IH K [DEL]"   (no phoneme deleted, just a tag added)
   ```

2. In IPA format:
   ``` 
   CORRECT:   "mˈɪ[DEL]k"     (l deleted from "milk")
   WRONG:     "mˈɪlk[DEL]"      (no phoneme deleted, just a tag added)
   WRONG:     "mˈɪk"      (phoneme deleted but no [DEL] tag)
   ```

### Valid Output Example:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "dysfluent_word": "milk",
        "ipa_correct": "mˈɪlk",
        "cmu_correct": "M IH L K",
        "ipa_dysfluent": "mˈɪ[DEL]k",
        "cmu_dysfluent": "M IH [DEL] K",
        "category": "Liquid"
    }
]
```

### Invalid Examples:

```json
// INVALID - No actual phoneme deleted
{
    "cmu_dysfluent": "M IH L K [DEL]"  // Wrong: just added [DEL] tag without deleting a phoneme
}
```

### **Key Instructions:**

1. **Deletion Format**:
   - Replace a phoneme with the [DEL] tag.
   - Must be within a word.

2. **Phoneme Selection**:
   - Choose a phoneme that would create a natural deletion pattern.
   - Must consider phonological rules.

3. **Position Rules**:
   - Only delete within words.
   - Never at word boundaries.
   - Always delete an existing phoneme.

4. **Verification Steps**:
   - Check that a phoneme is actually deleted.
   - Verify [DEL] tag appears exactly where the phoneme was.
   - Confirm deletion is within a word.
   - Ensure no spaces around deletion tag.
   - Valid examples should contain one deletion that could naturally occur in speech.

### **Note**:
Generate the output as pure JSON data without additional instructions or explanations. Each sequence should include exactly one within-word deletion that creates a natural-sounding result.

Generate 10 pairs corresponding to the following input. All pairs at once, don't truncate the response.

### **Actual Input:**
