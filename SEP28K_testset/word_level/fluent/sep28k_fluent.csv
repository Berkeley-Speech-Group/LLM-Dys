/fluent/8.wav,I missed the first two days
/fluent/9.wav,If you do this
/fluent/10.wav,There are two ways you can do this.
/fluent/11.wav,You can record
/fluent/12.wav,Completely understand me.
/fluent/13.wav,And I will put that
/fluent/14.wav,Because you are not alone.
/fluent/15.wav,We're all in this together.
/fluent/16.wav,If I can learn from you

/fluent/18.wav,And that is why we are here.
/fluent/20.wav,They scared the dog away.
/fluent/21.wav,You are not alone.
/fluent/22.wav,How are you doing?
/fluent/23.wav,That's amazing!

/fluent/26.wav,I have a stutter
/fluent/27.wav,I thought about it.
/fluent/28.wav,Let me know if you
/fluent/29.wav,"So, as always."
/fluent/30.wav,I want to hear from you.
/fluent/31.wav,It's like an American holiday.
/fluent/32.wav,Because you are not alone.
/fluent/33.wav,Could you introduce yourself?
/fluent/34.wav,The embarrassment of doing that.
/fluent/35.wav,Because when I went to
/fluent/36.wav,I want for everyone to know.
/fluent/37.wav,And in here
/fluent/38.wav,As I am practicing
/fluent/39.wav,"Therefore, I did not stutter."
/fluent/40.wav,Of my body language
/fluent/41.wav,And guided me through that rough part of my high school life.
/fluent/42.wav,What you do to keep yourself busy?
/fluent/43.wav,And so I
/fluent/44.wav,When I have to do it.
/fluent/45.wav,Do you have any?
/fluent/46.wav,Now I do have my good days.
/fluent/47.wav,Has helped me
/fluent/48.wav,I began to run.
/fluent/49.wav,And one time
/fluent/50.wav,Nothing never happened.
/fluent/51.wav,Where you're from
/fluent/52.wav,"And, when I got out, I went to school"
/fluent/53.wav,To get started
/fluent/55.wav,She asks him
/fluent/56.wav,For the first time.
/fluent/57.wav,"In my life, I would love"
/fluent/58.wav,I would love to have a day
/fluent/59.wav,And just enjoy a simple conversation.
/fluent/60.wav,Their thoughts about their own speech
/fluent/61.wav,And so I would always
/fluent/62.wav,And communication skills.
/fluent/63.wav,Comparing myself to other people.
/fluent/64.wav,"Now, I can say"
/fluent/65.wav,I experienced a great deal of.
/fluent/66.wav,And they just took me some time
/fluent/69.wav,Public speaking situations
/fluent/70.wav,Focus on the other people
/fluent/72.wav,I was expanding all of my energy.
/fluent/73.wav,"Open conversation or class presentation any time I had to stand in front of a group of people."
/fluent/74.wav,They can tell a joke?
/fluent/75.wav,They can tell a funny story and have everybody laugh.
/fluent/77.wav,That is what I wanted.
/fluent/78.wav,A challenging time.
/fluent/79.wav,A lot of things change.
/fluent/80.wav,Certainly a part of my personal story.
/fluent/81.wav,I would always end up
/fluent/82.wav,"Evacative and powerful, and I was hoping you could."
/fluent/83.wav,If they don't like me
/fluent/84.wav,When I had to say something out loud
/fluent/85.wav,I embrace it. I accept it.
/fluent/86.wav,In front of a group of people.
/fluent/87.wav,And life is going to move on.
/fluent/88.wav,I think it's encouraging.
/fluent/89.wav,"And once I did that"
/fluent/91.wav,And that was a wonderful experience on that day.
/fluent/92.wav,That was my goal as well.
/fluent/93.wav,And I had to remind myself.
/fluent/94.wav,I really do.
/fluent/95.wav,Just meeting him casually
/fluent/96.wav,"I'm happy, I'm healthy."
/fluent/97.wav,The experience that she
/fluent/98.wav,I only surrounded myself with positive people.
/fluent/99.wav,Controll my life.
/fluent/100.wav,That is what I did
/fluent/101.wav,I realize I am not perfect.
/fluent/102.wav,Nobody is perfect.
/fluent/103.wav,And so I didn't realize
/fluent/105.wav,All those emotions.
/fluent/106.wav,"Compare myself, because I was insecure"
/fluent/107.wav,I didn't like who I was.
/fluent/108.wav,To be somebody else.
/fluent/109.wav,And so I would always.
/fluent/110.wav,Thank you so much!
/fluent/111.wav,Because I was desperate.
/fluent/112.wav,And I started to talk
/fluent/113.wav,We know that there's a lot of work to do.
/fluent/114.wav,It is all in progress
/fluent/115.wav,That we see in the disorder.
/fluent/116.wav,"It's also highly heritable, so we're going to be looking at transmission patterns."
/fluent/117.wav,But when I came to this culture
/fluent/118.wav,It's something so bad
/fluent/119.wav,For my whole life
