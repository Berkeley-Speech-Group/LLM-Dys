/fluent/1.wav,"In my eyes, I would look all over the place."
/fluent/2.wav,And I'm tired.
/fluent/6.wav,And it's also free
/fluent/7.wav,So I want to hear from you.
/fluent/8.wav,I missed the first two days
/fluent/9.wav,If you do this
/fluent/10.wav,There are two ways you can do this.
/fluent/11.wav,You can record
/fluent/12.wav,Completely understand me.
/fluent/13.wav,And I will put that
/fluent/14.wav,Because you are not alone.
/fluent/15.wav,We're all in this together.
/fluent/16.wav,If I can learn from you
/fluent/17.wav,Can learn from me
/fluent/18.wav,And that is why we are here.
/fluent/20.wav,They scared the dog away.
/fluent/21.wav,You are not alone.
/fluent/22.wav,How are you doing?
/fluent/23.wav,That's amazing!
/fluent/24.wav,"So, the call to action."
/fluent/26.wav,I have a stutter
/fluent/27.wav,I thought about it.
/fluent/28.wav,Let me know if you
/fluent/29.wav,"So, as always."
/fluent/30.wav,I want to hear from you.
/fluent/31.wav,It's like an American holiday.
/fluent/32.wav,Because you are not alone.
/fluent/33.wav,Could you introduce yourself?
/fluent/34.wav,The embarrassment of doing that.
/fluent/35.wav,Because when I went to
/fluent/36.wav,I want for everyone to know.
/fluent/37.wav,And in here
/fluent/38.wav,As I am practicing
/fluent/39.wav,"Therefore, I did not stutter."
/fluent/40.wav,Of my body language
/fluent/41.wav,And guided me through that rough part of my high school life.
/fluent/42.wav,What you do to keep yourself busy?
/fluent/43.wav,And so I
/fluent/44.wav,When I have to do it.
/fluent/45.wav,Do you have any?
/fluent/46.wav,Now I do have my good days.
/fluent/47.wav,Has helped me
/fluent/48.wav,I began to run.
/fluent/49.wav,And one time
/fluent/50.wav,Nothing never happened.
/fluent/51.wav,Where you're from
/fluent/52.wav,"And, when I got out, I went to school"
/fluent/53.wav,To get started
/fluent/55.wav,She asks him
/fluent/56.wav,For the first time.
/fluent/57.wav,"In my life, I would love"
/fluent/58.wav,I would love to have a day
/fluent/59.wav,And just enjoy a simple conversation.
/fluent/60.wav,Their thoughts about their own speech
/fluent/61.wav,And so I would always
/fluent/62.wav,And communication skills.
/fluent/63.wav,Comparing myself to other people.
/fluent/64.wav,"Now, I can say"
/fluent/65.wav,I experienced a great deal of.
/fluent/66.wav,And they just took me some time
/fluent/69.wav,Public speaking situations
/fluent/70.wav,Focus on the other people
/fluent/72.wav,I was expanding all of my energy.
/fluent/73.wav,"Open conversation or class presentation any time I had to stand in front of a group of people."
/fluent/74.wav,They can tell a joke?
/fluent/75.wav,They can tell a funny story and have everybody laugh.
/fluent/77.wav,That is what I wanted.
/fluent/78.wav,A challenging time.
/fluent/79.wav,A lot of things change.
/fluent/80.wav,Certainly a part of my personal story.
/fluent/81.wav,I would always end up
/fluent/82.wav,"Evacative and powerful, and I was hoping you could."
/fluent/83.wav,If they don't like me
/fluent/84.wav,When I had to say something out loud
/fluent/85.wav,I embrace it. I accept it.
/fluent/86.wav,In front of a group of people.
/fluent/87.wav,And life is going to move on.
/fluent/88.wav,I think it's encouraging.
/fluent/89.wav,"And once I did that"
/fluent/91.wav,And that was a wonderful experience on that day.
/fluent/92.wav,That was my goal as well.
/fluent/93.wav,And I had to remind myself.
/fluent/94.wav,I really do.
/fluent/95.wav,Just meeting him casually
/fluent/96.wav,"I'm happy, I'm healthy."
/fluent/97.wav,The experience that she
/fluent/98.wav,I only surrounded myself with positive people.
/fluent/99.wav,Controll my life.
/fluent/100.wav,That is what I did
/fluent/101.wav,I realize I am not perfect.
/fluent/102.wav,Nobody is perfect.
/fluent/103.wav,And so I didn't realize
/fluent/105.wav,All those emotions.
/fluent/106.wav,"Compare myself, because I was insecure"
/fluent/107.wav,I didn't like who I was.
/fluent/108.wav,To be somebody else.
/fluent/109.wav,And so I would always.
/fluent/110.wav,Thank you so much!
/fluent/111.wav,Because I was desperate.
/fluent/112.wav,And I started to talk
/fluent/113.wav,We know that there's a lot of work to do.
/fluent/114.wav,It is all in progress
/fluent/115.wav,That we see in the disorder.
/fluent/116.wav,"It's also highly heritable, so we're going to be looking at transmission patterns."
/fluent/117.wav,But when I came to this culture
/fluent/118.wav,It's something so bad
/fluent/119.wav,For my whole life
/insertion/1.wav,But you were also [INS] involved in a
/insertion/2.wav,Uusing one of those strategies [INS] that we like to call slow-stretch speech
/insertion/3.wav,And in terms of age [INS] the program
/insertion/4.wav,"So, what am I good at? Well [INS] I am very good at typing"
/insertion/5.wav,"Fariety of people, [INS] from the"
/insertion/6.wav,"What do I do? [INS] I stop talking."
/insertion/7.wav,"You had touched on this previously, [INS] when you're having a bed day"
/insertion/8.wav,So [INS] you may hear me prolong words
/insertion/9.wav,"I mean, I'm talking, [INS] nothing goes right."
/insertion/10.wav,"How do you handle, [INS] a bad speech day?"
/insertion/11.wav,"The start of, [INS] the person who studies"
/insertion/12.wav,"Well, [INS] Pedro was desperate"
/insertion/13.wav,"And, [INS] I'm really excited"
/insertion/14.wav,"Or has, [INS] an inability"
/insertion/15.wav,"That because, [INS] you have struggled with this and you were empowered."
/insertion/16.wav,"While there's something that we said then, [INS]."
/insertion/17.wav,"Let us know, [INS] who"
/insertion/18.wav,We are all posting sites or [INS] slightly different points of views.
/insertion/19.wav,All of those jobs. And so [INS] looking at that newspaper page
/insertion/20.wav,"The issue of stuttering is a bad habit, [INS] the other issue"
/insertion/21.wav,You need from day to day. [INS] We do have a big focus
/insertion/22.wav,About my experience [INS] about change
/insertion/23.wav,"I'm a big repone and believer in, [INS] our words."
/insertion/24.wav,That [INS] physical changes in speech.
/insertion/25.wav,And [INS] just in adding to what you shared
/insertion/26.wav,Through [INS] social media outlets
/insertion/27.wav,"Sure, so, [INS] in growing up"
/insertion/28.wav,So can you [INS] tell us a little bit about the inspiration behind your book?
/insertion/29.wav,To the point of even [INS] provoking a panic attack.
/insertion/30.wav,That particular experience itself [INS] just create a lot of fear.
/insertion/31.wav,"You have a, [INS] personal story."
/insertion/32.wav,Certainly so [INS] inspiration
/insertion/33.wav,About [INS] really diving deeper into
/insertion/34.wav,"So, [INS] it really started"
/insertion/35.wav,"Afterwards, [INS] being able to work with families and children in the schools."
/insertion/36.wav,"Okay, [INS] how did you come up with the title?"
/insertion/37.wav,"If you're equating success with fluency, [INS] you can feel like you're not helping."
/insertion/38.wav,"In order to, [INS] either"
/insertion/39.wav,But [INS] maybe off the time shied away from.
/insertion/40.wav,In more [INS] deep
/insertion/41.wav,"I think that, [INS] agency that you wish"
/insertion/42.wav,"Was that, [INS] you never really tell the?"
/insertion/43.wav,"That idea that, [INS] we have a lot of power in shaping our experiences"
/insertion/44.wav,"Just across settings, [INS] each particular person's"
/insertion/45.wav,And [INS] you shared your book with me.
/insertion/46.wav,And in terms of age [INS] the program
/insertion/90.wav,"Reflect it, but also, [INS] I can't."
/pause/1.wav,That's really as far as my [PAU] contributions have gone.
/pause/2.wav,And then have a great [PAU] career.
/pause/3.wav,During [PAU] all of those life events.
/pause/4.wav,Because I don't want to get [PAU] stuck on a word.
/pause/5.wav,Enjoying a nice quiet [PAU] Sunday over here.
/pause/6.wav,Because I wanted to [PAU] improve my policy.
/pause/7.wav,Thank you sir. I have been [PAU] enjoying your podcast.
/pause/8.wav,That is how I [PAU] would speak.
/pause/9.wav,I think we really do have something for [PAU] everyone.
/pause/10.wav,It made me [PAU] feel like I was broken.
/pause/11.wav,How is this [PAU] beast actually able to control us?
/pause/12.wav,I relax. Because once [PAU] I get home
/pause/13.wav,"Personally, I truly don't feel like [PAU] I have the choice of stuttering."
/pause/14.wav,We're the [PAU] hour for lunch.
/pause/15.wav,Each day [PAU] has a new theme?
/pause/16.wav,Today I have the opportunity and [PAU] pleasure to chat with.
/pause/17.wav,And [PAU] what do you think that's the case?
/pause/18.wav,That person had a ton of [PAU] friends
/pause/19.wav,I dealt with a lot of [PAU] personal challenges
/pause/20.wav,"I wanted to be that person [PAU] or this person."
/pause/24.wav,Influenced your [PAU] choice of career.
/pause/25.wav,And it's just [PAU] it's tough finding
/pause/26.wav,We [PAU] are uncomfortable with the
/pause/27.wav,And being [PAU] accepted
/repetition/1.wav,So [REP] we started last February.
/repetition/2.wav,And we [REP] do have a
/repetition/4.wav,So this person had asked me at the end of the [REP] day.
/repetition/6.wav,Sharing hard [REP] parts of his story today
/repetition/7.wav,"Bizzy right now, [REP] in a good way though."
/repetition/8.wav,And then after practice hold [REP] the
/repetition/9.wav,And so when [REP] I turn forty
/repetition/10.wav,And [REP] so I joined the
/repetition/11.wav,So today I have the opportunity to [REP] talk with
/repetition/12.wav,But with [REP] having a stutter
/repetition/13.wav,"Hey, how [REP] were you today?"
/repetition/14.wav,I said [REP] oh no what have I done?
/repetition/16.wav,I found [REP] it fascinating.
/repetition/17.wav,"And in fact, in the great spectrum of [REP] things"
/repetition/18.wav,Screaming at [REP] the top of my lungs.
/repetition/19.wav,If [REP] I paid her $100
/repetition/20.wav,But it's mostly a rate [REP] disorder in many.
/repetition/21.wav,I want to be this [REP] person.
/repetition/22.wav,Compare myself to [REP] other people
/repetition/23.wav,I'm experiencing a [REP] lot of emotions.
/repetition/24.wav,And so what [REP] I have learned
/repetition/25.wav,And how [REP] dare you!
/repetition/26.wav,It's just I [REP] cannot handle this anymore.
/repetition/27.wav,Thanks for taking the time to [REP] join me
